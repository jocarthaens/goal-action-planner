A custom implementation of GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Plan) AI framework. Included is a demo about an orc in a forest trying to fill its hunger by either gathering berries, hunting boars, or stealing the guarded taco, while trying to hide from satyrs if not equipped with a bonker. Its pool of actions will depend on what objects are within its surrounding area and if it is currently equipped with a bonker. The orc prioritizes sneaking for tacos, then hunting for boar meat, and foraging berries is its least priority. If the orc haven't found anything of interest within its vicinity, or if it is fully satiated, it will wander around for a while.
